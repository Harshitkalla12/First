As a large enterprise with a high volume of changes to software and infrastructure, our current change management process is highly manual and time-consuming.
Implementing COTG as an automated approach to change management will streamline our process and reduce manual efforts and time.
COTG's ability to create changes quickly and with minimal inputs means that our IT team can spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on strategic work.
With the ability to create N no. of child changes with just a parent change number and count required in lighting speed, COTG will help us manage complex changes more efficiently.
The ability to create tasks in change and assign them to any user or group will help us track and manage changes more effectively.
By reducing the risk of errors and delays in our change management process, COTG will help us deliver software and infrastructure changes more quickly and with greater reliability.
This will have a positive impact on our business operations and help us stay competitive in the market.
